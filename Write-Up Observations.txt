Observations 1. My first observation is about the code itself. I noticed that there were unique and interesting ways to use the datetime import in Python, for example, using it to subtract 365 days to find the data from exactly a year prior to the most recent information. To me, that was a simplified way to what couldʼve been a tough problem to solve without a function like that. 2. My second observation is about the precipitation data. Hawaii seems to have rainfall all throughout the year with a few spikes, which is expected for a tropical climate. My first question would be if this was a normal year of weather for Hawaii, and would want to look at prior years to see if Hawaii always has this much rainfall, or if this year is exceptionally heavy. If you are planning a vacation to Hawaii, it seems like there are many opportunities throughout the year where there will be minimal rainfall. For example, October, early January, or early April. 3. My third observation is about the temperature observations. The temperature with the highest frequency was 75 degrees, which paired with a rainy day might make you a little cold. This wouldnʼt be the ideal atmosphere for a tropical vacation, so if you were planning a trip to Hawaii, I would look at a temperature trend line over time to compare it with the precipitation data. This way you can find the times with the most comfortable temperature and the least rain possible.
